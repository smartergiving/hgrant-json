## Purpose  
Convert the [hGrant spec](http://foundationcenter.org/grantmakers/hgrant.html) to [JSON schema](http://json-schema.org/), making it much easier to create valid hGrants in JSON format.   

## Goal  
Enable the proliferation of hGrant plugins across platforms, including fast-growing static website generators like Jekyll and Hugo, database-driven CMSs like Drupal and Wordpress, and package managers like Node's NPM and Python's pip.     

## Background  
The hGrant spec is currently only publicly available in [PDF format](http://foundationcenter.org/grantmakers/hgrant.html). This means any developer wishing to integrate hGrant capabilities in their projects (e.g. the awesome [Open hGrant](http://openhgrant.org/) Wordpress plugin) needs to manually convert the human-readable PDF to machine-readable code.   

As the hGrant developer community grows, we wanted to do our part to make it as easy as possible for developers of all sizes to work with the hGrant spec.  

## Status  
Under active development.  
Current version: v0.1  

## Usage  
*Detailed usage instructions coming soon.*
